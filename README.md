# New Brunswick, NJ Historical Weather Data

See about:

- socket.io instead of fetch for streaming of data
- set up domain
- fix dark mode to dummie mode again (different colors and labels)
- comparison mode - Turn to bar graph view & list
- BE: best pogramming language for CI/CD development & cloud infrastructure (cost, secure, dev focused)
- Connect weather-data to dummie mode and disable it 100% in prod.
- Default to todays date and store the latest month in indexDB if its already been grabbed
