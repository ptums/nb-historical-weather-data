# New Brunswick, NJ Historical Weather Data

## MVP

- Sidebar of searched dates store in indexDB labeled "History"
- Deploy backend

### History Mode

### Comparison Mode

#### UI:

A second sidebar titled "Comparison" that lists dates to compare. Next to title there is a clear all button

When the user clicks a date from the sidebar a small modal appears w/ 2 buttons (compare, display). Compare adds the date to the comparison sidebar and the display changes to graph mode (if the list is not empty). Display renders the month's info in the grid.

Next to the year input there will be a button labeled "compare" when clicked will add the date to the comparison sidebar and the display changes to graph mode (if the list is not empty)
